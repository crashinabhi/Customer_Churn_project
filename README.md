## Overview of the Project

Customer Churn [or attrition] is considered to be one of the most important metrics of a growing business to evaluate. Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. Through our project we are trying to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires with a leading music straming service KKBOX [Asia's leading music straming service].

By the end of the project we are anticipating to discover new insights to why users leave so the service can be proactive in keeping users. 

The following technical analysis are to be done:

> 1. Preprocessing Data for a Machine Language Model
> 2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
> 3. Optimize the Model
